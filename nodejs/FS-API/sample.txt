So recently I found out that a ducks penis is corkscrewed, and I is like this becuase the female vaginal canal is corkscrewed...but in the opposite direction. Male ducks would force sex on the female ducks so the female duck s developed a twisted vaginal canal, so the male ducks followed up by having a twisted penis, to counter this the females reversed their anatomy and made it much harder for them to reproduce. So I wondered, why wouldn't this trait die off if it was unfavorable for reproduction. Please reply with thoughts and answers.
